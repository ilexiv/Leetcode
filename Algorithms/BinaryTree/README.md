# Binary Tree

**Description:**

A binary tree (BT) is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children,
which are referred to as the left child and the right child. [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)

A binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree,
is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all
the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

Ancestor: any node from the root to node x.

Successor (the node stay ahead of given node: left-most node of right subtree or successor is an ancestor*.

Predecessor (the node stay behind of given node): right-most node of left subtree or successor is an ancestor*.
